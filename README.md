Technologies
In order to design maintenance software the basic requirements would be: a powerful Platform, reliable storage capability and a simple interface. All these have been accomplished by Python, a powerful cross-platform language that can run in any device with a Windows or GNU/Linux Interface. When coding an application, there is a requirement for dynamic content fulfilled by SQL. The mainly used technologies for the coding process of the software have been introduced below.

# Python Programming
Python is an interpreter, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding; make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Tkinter GUI & PySQL Database access has been immensly used to design this software.

The software is designed to use this technology due to the above said reasons, to connect to the valued customers securely.

# SQL
When coding an application, the decision to use SQL is a requirement for dynamic content. SQL is a database application that can be used by large or small businesses. SQL Queries can be used to retrieve large amounts of records from a database quickly and efficiently. SQL databases use long-established standard, which is being adopted by ANSI & ISO. Non-SQL databases do not adhere to any clear standard. Using standard SQL it is easier to manage database systems without having to write substantial amount of code. With the emergence of Object Oriented DBMS, object storage capabilities are extended to relational databases.

We have used PySQL Database access for safe and secure storage of stock data. SQL Database has a huge advantage over the temporary storage variables list, tuples and dictionaries in python which has been explained in the next section.
